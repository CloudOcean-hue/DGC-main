# Disentangled Information Quantification for Dataset Construction in Data-Centric AI

This repository will provide the official implementation of our paper:  
**"Disentangled Information Quantification for Dataset Construction in Data-Centric AI"** *(under review)*.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Modern data-centric AI requires not only large-scale datasets but also **informative, diverse, and disentangled samples** to achieve generalizable and reliable performance.  
Our work introduces a **principled framework** to quantify and leverage the *information content of datasets* through disentangled representations.

The repository will release **three major components**:

1. **OF-SQAE**  
   A disentangled representation learning model designed to capture semantic factors and provide structured latent codes.

2. **IAIQ (Information-Aware Information Quantification)**  
   Theoretical and algorithmic tools to measure dataset informativeness, grounded in disentanglement and information theory.

3. **DGC (Dataset Generation and Construction)**  
   Practical algorithms for constructing high-information datasets under the guidance of IAIQ, enabling efficient data selection and augmentation.

## 📌 Key Features (Coming Soon)

- End-to-end implementation of **OF-SQAE** for learning interpretable semantic representations.  
- Open-source toolkit for **quantifying dataset information** using the IAIQ framework.  
- Reproducible **data construction pipelines** to build compact yet highly informative datasets.  
- Comprehensive benchmarks and ablation studies (to be released after publication).
